## 🤝 Collaborative Rendering: How the Freeze Workflow Works

**The Core Problem:** Each analyst has their own data on their machine. How do we render the full book without requiring everyone's data in one place?

**The Solution:** Quarto's `freeze: auto` mode caches execution results so analysts can share outputs without sharing raw data.

### Understanding Freeze Mode

When you render your chapter with `freeze: auto` enabled:

1. **Quarto executes your code** (R) using your local data
2. **All outputs are cached** (plots, tables, results) in the `_freeze/` directory
3. **You commit both source and cache** to git
4. **Others render the full book** using your cached outputs
5. **Their Quarto skips re-executing your code** - uses cached results instead
6. **Only modified chapters re-execute** when source files change

### What Gets Shared vs. Local

| Item | Location | Git Tracked | Why |
|------|----------|-------------|-----|
| **Source code** (`.qmd`) | `chapters/XX-topic/` | ✅ Yes | Your analysis narrative |
| **Cached outputs** | `_freeze/` | ✅ Yes | Rendered plots, tables, results |
| **Raw data** | `data/raw/` | ❌ No | Often sensitive, stays local |
| **Processed data** | `data/processed/` | ❌ No | Intermediate datasets |
| **Final HTML/PDF** | `_output/` | ❌ No | Generated from cache |

### Step-by-Step Collaborative Workflow

#### 1️⃣ **You:** Work on Your Chapter

```bash
# Edit your chapter
code chapters/05-environment/index.qmd

# Render your chapter (generates cache)
quarto render chapters/05-environment/index.qmd
```

**What happens:**

- Quarto runs your R code with your local data
- Generates plots, tables, calculations
- Saves results to `_freeze/html/chapters/05-environment/`

#### 2️⃣ **You:** Commit Source AND Cache

```bash
# Critical: Commit BOTH files
git add chapters/05-environment/index.qmd
git add _freeze/chapters/05-environment/

git commit -m "Update environment chapter: add renewable energy analysis"
git push
```

**Important:** If you forget to commit `_freeze/`, others can't render the book!

#### 3️⃣ **Others:** Render Full Book Without Your Data

```bash
git pull  # Get your changes

quarto render  # Render full book
```

**What happens:**

- Quarto sees your `_freeze/` cache is up to date
- Uses your cached outputs instead of re-executing your code
- Assembles all chapters into complete book
- Only re-executes chapters where source files changed

### Common Scenarios

#### **Scenario: You update your chapter**

```bash
# Edit your chapter
nano chapters/05-environment/index.qmd

# Re-render to update cache
quarto render chapters/05-environment/index.qmd

# Commit both source and updated cache
git add chapters/05-environment/
git add _freeze/chapters/05-environment/
git commit -m "Add solar panel installation trends"
git push
```

#### **Scenario: You want to force re-execution**

```bash
# Force refresh even if source unchanged (e.g., data updated)
quarto render chapters/05-environment/index.qmd --execute-freeze refresh
```

#### **Scenario: Someone forgot to commit _freeze/**

**Symptom:** Rendering fails with "data file not found" for their chapter

**Fix:** Ask them to:

```bash
quarto render chapters/XX-topic/index.qmd
git add _freeze/
git commit -m "Add missing freeze cache"
git push
```

#### **Scenario: Merge conflict in _freeze/**

**Rare but possible if two people edit the same chapter simultaneously**

```bash
# Delete your local freeze cache for that chapter
rm -rf _freeze/html/chapters/XX-topic/

# Re-render your version
quarto render chapters/XX-topic/index.qmd

# Commit fresh cache
git add _freeze/
git commit -m "Resolve freeze cache conflict"
```

### Checking Cache Status

**Preview what will re-execute:**

```bash
quarto render --dry-run
```

**Force re-render everything:**

```bash
quarto render --execute-freeze refresh
```

**Render just your chapter for testing:**

```bash
quarto render chapters/05-environment/index.qmd
```

### Troubleshooting

#### "Full book won't render - missing data file"

**Cause:** Someone didn't commit their `_freeze/` cache

**Fix:**

1. Check which chapter is failing
2. Ask that person to render their chapter and commit `_freeze/`
3. Pull their changes and try again

#### "My chapter re-executes every time even though I didn't change it"

**Cause:** Source file timestamp changed (e.g., git operations)

**Fix:**

```bash
# Clear cache and re-render once
rm -rf _freeze/html/chapters/XX-topic/
quarto render chapters/XX-topic/index.qmd
```

#### "_freeze/ directory is huge in git"

**Unlikely but possible with many large plots**

**Fix:**

- Optimise figure sizes in code chunks (`fig-width`, `fig-height`, `dpi`)
- Use compressed formats (PNG instead of SVG for complex plots)
- Consider Git LFS (ask team lead)

### Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Render your chapter | `quarto render chapters/XX-topic/index.qmd` |
| Render full book | `quarto render` |
| Preview with live reload | `quarto preview` |
| Force re-execute | `quarto render --execute-freeze refresh` |
| check what will run | `quarto render --dry-run` |

## 🌿 Git Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use this pattern: `yourname/chapter-or-feature`

**Examples:**

- `heather/transport` - Heather working on transport chapter
- `alex/environment` - Alex working on environment chapter
- `sarah/weca-theme-update` - Sarah updating the WECA theme

**Rules:**

- ✅ Use lowercase
- ✅ Use hyphens to separate words
- ✅ Include your name or initials
- ❌ Don't use spaces or special characters

### Creating a Branch

```bash
# Start from main
git checkout main
git pull

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b yourname/chapter-name

# Verify you're on the right branch
git branch
```

---

## 💬 Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages that explain **what changed and why**.

### Format

Use the **imperative mood** (like giving a command):

```
✅ Add bus ridership indicator
✅ Fix data loading error in transport chapter
✅ Update WECA color palette
✅ Remove outdated employment data
```

**Not this:**

```
❌ Added stuff
❌ Fixed things
❌ Updates
❌ WIP
```

### Commit Message Template

```
<action> <what changed>

Optional: More details if needed
- Why this change was made
- Any relevant context
- Related issue numbers
```

**Examples:**

```
Add housing affordability indicator to place chapter

Includes:
- Data from ONS housing market statistics
- Trend analysis 2015-2024
- Comparison with national average
```

```
Fix percentage calculation in skills indicator

The previous formula didn't account for null values,
causing incorrect percentages in some years.
```

### Commit Frequency

- **Commit often** - small, logical chunks
- **One feature per commit** - easier to review and revert
- **Test before committing** - ensure code runs

```bash
# Good workflow
git add chapters/02-transport/index.qmd
git commit -m "Add bus ridership indicator"

git add chapters/02-transport/index.qmd
git commit -m "Add rail passenger numbers indicator"

# Not this
git add .
git commit -m "Finished transport chapter"
```

## 🎨 Code Style Guide

### R Style

**General principles:**

- Use `<-` for assignment (not `=`)
- Use snake_case for variable names
- Load packages at the top of code chunks
- Use relative paths from the project root for file paths

**Example:**

```r
#| label: load-data

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
source(here::here("scripts", "R", "theme_weca.R"))

# Load and process data
employment_data <- load_csv(here::here("data", "raw", "employment.csv")) %>%
  filter(year >= 2015) %>%
  mutate(
    employment_rate = safe_divide(employed, total_population) * 100
  )

# Visualize
ggplot(employment_data, aes(x = year, y = employment_rate)) +
  geom_line(colour = get_weca_color("forest_green")) +
  theme_weca() +
  labs(
    title = "Employment Rate Trend",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Employment Rate (%)"
  )
```

### Quarto Code Chunk Options

**Standard settings:**

```r
#| label: descriptive-name
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Descriptive caption for accessibility"
```

**Hide code by default** (already set globally):

- `code-fold: false` is in `_quarto.yml`
- Users can't toggle code visibility

---

## 📁 File Naming Conventions

### Data Files

**Format:** `descriptor_YYYY-MM-DD.ext`

**Examples:**

- `bus_ridership_2024-01-15.csv`
- `housing_prices_processed_2024-02-01.csv`
- `employment_ONS_2024-01-20.xlsx`

**Rules:**

- Use lowercase
- Use underscores to separate words
- Include date stamp for time-sensitive data
- Include source if helpful (e.g., `_ONS`, `_DfT`)

### Script Files

**Format:** `purpose_description.ext`

**Examples:**

- `theme_weca.R` ✅
- `data_cleaning_utilities.R` ✅
- `plot_helper_functions.R` ✅

## 🚫 What NOT to Commit

**Never commit:**

- ❌ `.env` files (blocked by pre-commit hook)
- ❌ API keys, passwords, tokens
- ❌ Large data files (>10MB)
- ❌ Rendered outputs (`.html`, `.pdf`) - these are generated
- ❌ Personal credentials or sensitive data

**Why?**

- Git history is permanent - secrets can't be easily removed
- Large files bloat the repository
- Rendered outputs should be generated fresh

**What to do instead:**

- Use environment variables for secrets
- Store large files in shared drives or Databricks
- Add patterns to `.gitignore`

## 🆘 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Merge Conflict

**What happened:** Two people edited the same file.

**How to resolve:**

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Git will mark conflicts in your files
# Open the file and look for:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> main

# Choose which version to keep (or combine them)
# Remove the conflict markers
# Save the file

# Mark as resolved
git add filename.qmd
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in transport chapter"
```

### Scenario 2: Accidentally Committed to Main

**Fix:**

```bash
# Create branch from current state
git branch yourname/chapter-name

# Reset main to match remote
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# Your changes are safe on the new branch
git checkout yourname/chapter-name
```

### Scenario 3: Need to Undo Last Commit

```bash
# Undo commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo commit and discard changes (careful!)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Scenario 4: Want to Update Branch with Latest Main

```bash
# On your feature branch
git checkout yourname/chapter-name

# Get latest main
git fetch origin main

# Merge main into your branch
git merge origin/main

# Or rebase (cleaner history)
git rebase origin/main
```
